Este video no muestra aviones israelíes destruidos por bombardeos de Irán\n","👤 Autor: AGUSTÍN SOSA\n","📅 Fecha: 15/06/2025\n","✅ Veredicto: falsos\n","📜 Contenido: En el contexto del conflicto entre Israel e Irán, tras el ataque del Mosad a las instalaciones nucleares de la ciudad de Isfahán, se ha viralizado por redes sociales un video que supuestamente muestra varios aviones israelíes destruidos por la contraofensiva iraní. Sin embargo, se trata de un video hecho con inteligencia artificial. El video dura 16 segundos y muestra un aeródromo militar destruido supuestamente por los bombardeos iraníes en respuesta al sabotaje de inteligencia hecho por Israel. En la escena se observan varios cazas tipo F-35 o F-36 en malas condiciones, dañados por las consecuencias del ataque con misiles del ejército de Irán. Publicaciones desinformativas por las redes de X y Facebook. Foto: capturas de pantalla PUEDES VER: Este video no muestra el bombardeo de Israel a las instalaciones nucleares de Irán \"El orgullo de Israel está destruido...\", se lee en la mayoría de bulos que traen este video como prueba. Hasta la publicación de esta verificación, se ha identificado que el posteo más viral se halla en la red social de X (antes Twitter), que ha logrado recopilar 731.200 visualizaciones, 15.000 'me gusta', 3.000 republicaciones por diversos usuarios en sus muros personales y 1.000 comentarios. Para encontrar el origen del metraje, realizamos una captura de pantalla a uno de los fotogramas y lo revisamos mediante una búsqueda inversa. Encontramos que el video ya estaba creado desde el 22 de mayo y fue publicado por un usuario árabe que realiza este tipo de contenidos hechos con IA sobre los conflictos en medio oriente. En la descripción de su canal de TikTok señala \"Inteligencia artificial\". También analizamos de manera manual los fotogramas del bulo y encontramos varias observaciones. Entre ellas, la principal, es de que los aviones cazas israelíes no llevan la Estrella de David en sus alas, sino en la parte posterior de la cabina del piloto; también las pinturas difieren dependiendo del tipo de caza, por ejemplo, los F-35 israelíes están pintados de color plomo, mientras que los F-15 de marrón pálido. Diferencias entre un caza israelí y los cazas del bulo. Foto: composición LR/Infobae PUEDES VER: Estos videos no exponen cómo \"amaneció\" Tel Aviv el 14 de junio tras el ataque de Irán: son IA Otra observación es que, en muchos de los aviones destruidos, se notan distorsiones en varias partes, como alas de más, símbolos judíos sin forma y cabinas repetidas, también en algunas fachadas vemos supuestas frases en hebreo que, en realidad, son galimatías de la inteligencia artificial. Sobre aviones derribados por Irán, se sabe que su sistema de defensa aérea logró impactar a dos cazas F-35, pero no se tiene más información al respecto. Ante ello, Israel respondió contradiciendo el comunicado del ejército iraní, indicando que, hasta el momento, no han detectado bajas entre sus tropas aéreas. Esta información corrobora que el video del bulo no es coherente con la realidad. Usuario iraní que publica contenido hecho con inteligencia artificial con temáticas de las guerras en medio oriente. Foto: captura de pantalla No hay registros exactos sobre aviones israelíes destruidos por el ejército de Irán tras los bombardeos selectivos del Mosad contra infraestructuras nucleares. El video del bulo proviene de una cuenta que publica contenido hecho con inteligencia artificial; además, tras realizar observaciones manuales, encontramos varias incoherencias con la realidad. Por lo tanto, calificamos estos posteos como falsos.\n","🔗 URL:
